## Using the five planes of UX design
### Strategy
It is not possible to compete for business solely on a local level. Companies have a plethora of resources at their disposal in this day and age. One of them is to compete online by having a website that can help a business stand out in the overcrowded world of fine dining.

- Build Raza Noodles a website to connect them with customers so they can experience their Asian cuisine.
- We can address the needs of users by having a website to browse and having relevant content.

The strategy:

    - Research:
        - Check out the Market.
        - Observe the competition.
        - Find commonalities between the competition.

    - Goals to keep in mind for the website:
        - A high level of design.
        - Contrasting images.
        - Fonts and sizes.
        - The responsivity for devices.

    - Outcomes after research:
        - A food menu is top priority.
        - Gallery page is a must have.
        - Don't distract the customer with the background.
        - Images need to be carefully selected for quality.
        - Address and contact number need to be on the landing page no matter what.

### Scope
Bringing reality inline with content is difficult. These are the current targets of the website.

Targets: 

    - Navigation for the website
        - Menu bar.
        - Ease of access.
        - Digestible content.
    - Different web pages for content
        - Home page.
        - Food menu.
        - Contact page.
        - Gallery page showcasing food.
        - Policy pages for terms, privacy and cookies.
    - Relevant sections
        - Address and location.
        - About Raza Noodles.

# Deployment
When I finished the homepage for Raza Noodles, I looked for a way to deploy the website. As a deployment solution, I chose the version control system GitHub. They have an excellent resource called GitHub pages that allows developers to visually inspect how their website would look on a cloud platform.

1. To begin, I went to the repository and selected 'settings.'
2. I went to the 'pages' section.
3. I chose the master branch as the 'main' branch under 'source.'
4. I ensured that it was deployed from the 'root' directory.
5. Once completed, I got the website's URL.

## Content
### The logo
I created the branding logo with help from here [hatchful.shopify.com](https://hatchful.shopify.com/).
I tried to keep in mind that this was an Asian style restaurant and chose the appropriate design for the logo after careful consideration.
The logo features an icon that intuitively shows a bowl of noodles and chopsticks.

### Icons
