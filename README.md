They employ great chefs from all over the world whose mission is to give consumers award-winning cuisine. Raza Noodles takes pride in providing a flavorful experience to Irish customers that is unlike any other on the island. This website hopes to deliver on that ambition for both Raza Noodles and the customers interested in their food.

Heres a link to the [website](https://kristiancolville1.github.io/raza-noodles/).

## Using the five planes of UX design
<hr>
<details>
<summary>Strategy</summary>
<br>

## Strategy
It is not possible to compete for business solely on a local level. Companies have a plethora of resources at their disposal in this day and age. One of them is to compete online by having a website that can help a business stand out in the overcrowded world of fine dining.

- Build Raza Noodles a website to connect them with customers so they can experience their Asian cuisine.
- We can address the needs of users by having a website to browse and having relevant content.

The strategy:

    - Research:
        - Check out the Market.
        - Observe the competition.
        - Find commonalities between the competition.

    - Goals to keep in mind for the website:
        - A high level of design.
        - Contrasting images.
        - Fonts and sizes.
        - The responsivity for devices.

    - Outcomes after research:
        - A food menu is top priority.
        - Gallery page is a must have.
        - Don't distract the customer with the background.
        - Images need to be carefully selected for quality.
        - Address and contact number need to be on the landing page no matter what.

<summary>Scope</summary>
<br>

## Scope
It is difficult for a developer to balance reality and content. This table ranks the design of elements 1 through 6 in order of importance. The most important is one, and the least important is six.
My potential design elements are important, but categorizing them is a useful way of completing them for the website's user.

| Features: | Users score: | Raza Noodles score: | Difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Branding logo | 4 | 1 | 3 |
| Landing page | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| Food Menu | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| Address | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| Contact Number | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| About section | 5 | 3 | 2 |
| Opening Hours Section | 1 | 2 | 1 |
| Internal links | 2 | 3 | 1 |

### Skeleton
Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).
Here is the PDF that I made for this UX plane: [KC Wireframes](/assets/media-files/raza-noodle-wireframes.pdf)

I created this website as a desktop first website and worked backwards to create it on smaller screens. You can see what I did to do this in the [Responsive Design](#responsive-design) section.

<details>
<summary>Surface</summary>
<br>

### Surface
<hr>

#### Colors

Food is frequently connected with the colors orange and purple. The website's colors represent the fact that this is a food business.

Orange and purple are also excellent color contrasts.

For the major contrast on the website, I used two darker hues. Dark purple with a hint of orange peel. The two are a perfect complement.

All the colors chosen for Raza Noodles are listed below. For all pages, the color black was also applied to increase the accessibility score. Against most hues, black is the easiest to read. Because my off-white hue didn't work well in the footer, I went with black.

![Colors](/assets/images/ux-design/colors.png)

Logo, menu items & icons: 

    - Orange Peel.

Background:

    - Dark Purpel.

Footer: 

    - Black social media icons for accessibility reasons and 
    - Lavender Floral background.
    - Orange Peel when hovered over.

Scroll icons on hover:

    - Rose Madder.

Text:

    - Baby Powder.


#### Fonts

The fonts chosen were [Luxurious Roman](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Luxurious+Roman#glyphs) and [Rock Salt](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rock+Salt). Both sourced from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

The logo, headings and titles:

    - Rock salt

The text:

    - luxurious Roman

<br>
On the main home page is the logo and logo fade design. 

- The user can see a contact number and address.

The menu bar features in the top right corner, this is a modern and intuitive design.

- The logo is also present in the top left corner and has a link to the home page. 

- All sections, internal links and external links are either present on the landing page or can be indicated to.

<br>
</details>

<details>

<br>
Included on all internal pages at the top of the page. Allows access to internal links and the different sections on the home page.

        - Sign in page.
    - Downloadable pdf documents.

<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hamburger Menu</summary>
<br>
This was a fun feature to create. 

I'm proud of the fact that it's all HTML5 and CSS3. I could have used a script for this with bootstrap but I felt the purpose of this project for myself as the developer was to stretch my coding muscles in HTML5 and CSS3.

Users with smaller screens (881px wide and below) can use a hamburger menu with this feature.

- When there are several menu selections, it helps the website maintain structural integrity. I have multiple menu options available to the user. It was needed if I wanted to be able attempt to make it responsive and cosmetically appealing. 

![Hamburger Menu](/assets/images/features/hamburger-one.png)
![Hamburger Menu](/assets/images/features/hamburger-two.png)
<br>
</details>

        - Twitter.
        - Instagram.
        - Linkedin.

These policy pages were created using a generator are not my own work. After completing the scope for the UX design I decided these pages were the least of my worries. They are essentially cosmetic. The project has a deadline and I do not have the time to build these. Using a generator saved time for other aspects of the website. These policy pages were created using [TermsFeed](https://www.termsfeed.com/).

- They include relevant content you might find on other websites.

<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Opening Hours section</summary>
<br>
This section allows the user of the website to see opening hours for Raza Noodles. 

- It features a fixed background and the text is wrapped in another background to make it visually easier to read for the user.

![Opening-hours section](/assets/images/features/opening-hours-section.png)
<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Menu Page</summary>
<br>
The second internal page after the home page is the menu page. It features some of the information from the home page such as the address and phone number. It has one of my scroll icons to go further down the page. 

This helps add cohesiveness to the design for the user, they are shown the address and phone number again after landing on the home page this is where they might go next if they are interested in browsing for options to eat when they arrive at Raza Noodles.

The background effect consists of an animation written in css that comes forwards. The background has an orange color effect. This was done with a background blend mode style property I found in [CSS documentation](https://devdocs.io/css/).

![Menu-page](/assets/images/features/menu-page.png)


<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Food Menu</summary>
<br>
On the menu page we also have the actual food menu. This allows the user to see what options are available to them and fufills design requirements by Raza Noodles for a competitive design.
The food menu has multiple images and relevant content in the menu for the user to explore.

- At the beginning of the food menu theres a second option for downloading the food menu.

![Download option](/assets/images/features/download-option-two.png)

- The link in the menu bar shows a 3 piece menu and it helps make the menu page cohesive when navigated to.

- The menu presents the illusion that it is a three-piece fold out menu on larger screens.

- Animations have been included to show different noodle dishes.

![Food-menu](/assets/images/features/three-piece-menu.png)

- On medium screens its a two-piece fold out menu and having the inset border in between each section creates these classic menu looks whilst adding abit of creativity.

![Food-menu](/assets/images/features/two-piece-menu.png)

- For small screens the menu becomes a single column and shows how adaptible this food menu is. The food menu section has 3 major shift changes overall for different screen sizes.

- The user can view this menu to decide what they might buy when visiting Raza Noodles.
    - The website has content the user would like to explore if dining out here.

![Food-menu](/assets/images/features/one-piece-menu.png)


<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Gallery Page</summary>
<br>

Another internal page included is the gallery page. This allows users to see Raza Noodle photos and get to see some foods prepared by Raza Noodles.

![Gallery Page](/assets/images/features/gallery-page.png)

<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Contact page</summary>
<br>

This feature allows users to send Raza Noodles a message and is another way to reach them. 

- The user must fill in their personal information correctly to be able submit feedback, and the page instructs them on how to do so.
    - Alerts the user for example if an entry is missing or an email is invalid.

- It is a dummy form that allows the user to share their experience while also allowing Raza Noodles to 'possibly' receive feedback. 

![contact page](/assets/images/features/contact-page.png)


<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Thank you page</summary>
<br>

After the user submits a message through the dummy form to Raza Noodles on the contact page a new internal page opens presenting the illusion that the user is still on the same page.

- It gives the user a response saying thank you. 

- It has a second option to return to the home page right below the thank you message.

- It is, at the very least, a pleasant feature that is just cosmetic but gives the site a more legitimate appearance for the user.
    - The user is kept on the website instead of their browser reporting the error and a blank screen, which helps to keep retention of the user.

![Thank you page](/assets/images/features/thank-you-page.png)


<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Animations</summary>
<br>

The Raza Noodle logo has an animation on the home screen. 

- For the user, this animation adds some elegance to the landing page on their arrival each time they visit the home page.

![Logo animation](/assets/images/features/animation-one.png)

The second animation is on the menu landing page. 

- The backgroud has a color effect done with background blend mode in css. It shows the background scale up when the user goes to this page.

![Logo animation](/assets/images/features/menu-page.png)

The third animation is on the food menu. It features two image containers that switch between images every 9 seconds, there is also a delay added so the user will get to see multiple images after going to this section. 

- The user gets to see different dishes made by Raza Noodles
    - Provides insights to the type of dishes.
    - What they might look like when prepared.
    - The quality of the food.

![Logo animation](/assets/images/features/animation-two.png)
![Logo animation](/assets/images/features/animation-three.png)


<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Sign in page</summary>
<br>

- Users can log in or create an account on the website. 

- The user must fill in their personal information correctly to be able sign in or sign up, and the page instructs them on how to do so.

There are two forms for the sign-in options.

- The user is directed to our 404 error page after completing the form. 

Raza Noodles currently does not have any servers available to handle user data. 

More information about this may be found in the features that still need to be implemented. [Features left to implement](#features-left-to-implement).

![Sign in page](/assets/images/features/sign-in-page.png)

<br>
</details>
<details>
<summary>404 error page</summary>
<br>

As mentioned previously for the sign in page the 404 error page is displayed when the user completes a sign in option.

- Its mostly decorative with the intent of being a message Raza Noodle can choose to display. 

I chose to alert the user that currently the server is down and to check back again later. 

- It also provides the user with away back to the home page after an error occurs.

- It helps the user know this is a legitimate website by having its own 404 error page.

![404 error page](/assets/images/features/error-page.png)

<br>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Downloadable content, Address and phone number</summary>
<br>

The website features 3 ways the user can view the menu; The drop down menu option for download, the food menu page, & the option for download in the food menu. All providing the user a content rich menu to explore.

![Download option](/assets/images/features/download-option-one.png)
![Download option](/assets/images/features/download-option-two.png)

- Raza Noodles' address and phone number can be found on the landing page and menu page. 

- I've included html code that allows the user to dial the phone number just by pressing it.

Raza Noodles needs the ability for users to call them when they visit the website. 

- The user will be asked if they wish to call the number by just tapping the number.
    - I've indicated this by placing a calling icon next to the phone number.

To help the user understand that this is a calling feature, it is the same color as the menu options.

![Address phone](/assets/images/features/address-phone.png)

<br>
</details>

## Features left to implement
<hr>
This is a static website.

- The website makes extensive use of just HTML5 and CSS3.
    - I would like to see JavaScript implemented throughout the site in later editions.

The aspirations listed below are currently outside the scope of this project. 

- I either don't have the skills to integrate these features yet or haven't been able to find the resources on time.

They can't be executed in most cases since they are outside of my present time frame and/or demand me to learn new abilities that I don't have time on hand to learn at the moment.

- When starting from scratch, building and launching a smartphone application, for example, could take weeks. These would take time to build, but with careful planning and the acquisition of the necessary skills, they could be done.

### Aspirations for this website

- A smartphone application.
    - To compete with other businesses.

- An online delivery service.
    - Allowing the user to place an order via the internet.

- A system for making payments.
    - Reservations, bookings, and online orders.

- A cookie pop-up banner.
    - Request permission to use cookies.

- A pop-up banner for COVID19.
    - Inform the user of any current health policies, alternative opening hours, or guidelines.

- Advertising.
    - Increase revenue by showing advertisements to users.

- Web-based servers.
    - Cloud technology.
    - Take care of traffic and data management.

- Analysis of user data.
    - Recognize patterns and forecast future events.

- More menu options/pages.
    - Reservations, online delivery,  etc.

## Responsive Design

I was able to make the website responsive by primarily using pixels and percentages. The maximum screen sizes, which I implemented, allow the site to adapt to various user screens.
[Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) was the tool I used to make the site responsive.

- Many features were not affected until certain widths were reached and those are indicated as n/a.

These adjustments did not apply to the external pages because the policys were created using a generator. External links to other websites were not included in the adjustments because I don't own those websites.

- Personal breakpoints for the website are also denoted with 'pbp'. 

The most work needs to be done on the Menu page, which was done on purpose because it is a key feature of the Raza Noodles website. 

The Menu page layout changes dramatically for different screen sizes. It was the most challenging to make responsive, but personal breakpoints made it incredibly adaptable.

Below are set widths provided by chrome developer tools, I also used other max widths but have not included them in the table to improve the readability.

| features / widths | 1920px | 1440px | 1024px | 768px | 425px | 375px | 320px |
| -------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Menu                 | Shown | Shown | Shown | Hidden | Hidden | Hidden | Hidden |
| Hamburger menu        | Hidden | Hidden | Hidden | Shown | Shown | Shown | Shown |
| logos                | n/a | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | Adjusted | n/a | n/a |
| Landing page         | n/a | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | Adjusted | Adjusted | n/a |
| Dropdown menu        | n/a | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | Adjusted | n/a | n/a |
| Logo fade            | n/a | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | Adjusted | Adjusted | n/a |
| Scroll icons         | n/a | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | Adjusted | Adjusted | n/a |
| About section        | n/a | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | Adjusted | Adjusted | n/a |
| Opening hours section | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | Adjusted | Adjusted | n/a | Adjusted |
| Footer               | n/a | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | Adjusted | Adjusted | n/a |
| External Links       | x | x | x | x | x | x | x |
| Menu page            | pbp | pbp | pbp | pbp | pbp | pbp | pbp |
| Gallery page         | n/a | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | n/a | pbp | n/a |
| Sign in page         | n/a | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | n/a | Adjusted | n/a |
| Thank you page       | n/a | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| Contact page         | n/a | n/a | n/a | pbp | Adjusted | n/a | n/a |
| 404 page             | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |

I experimented with many approaches for making the site responsive and discovered that using pixels was the most accurate and straightforward method for converting the various items on the pages to a suitable format for each screen size. Because the different portions of this website are all positioned 'absolute,' it made the most sense to use pixels to make it responsive. By doing it this way, I was able to save time. Because of this design, the screen's height is irrelevant.

I tried using viewport height as the unit of measurement for elements on the page, but it had an unacceptably large impact on structural integrity. I can see how these units of measurement could be really useful.
It's just trying to keep the responsive design in mind, which is tricky with viewport height and width. For starters, different gadgets come in a variety of heights and widths. If this design was for a specific device I would find those units of measurement very handy to have.

## Validator Testing
### HTML5

All internal pages passed official [W3C Validator testing](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea). The policy pages are excluded as they are were generated. I tested my pages by putting the URL of each page into their HTML checker.

I corrected all problems the html checker indicated. The html checker pointed out missing aria labels, incorrect id's, classes and semantic issues. All were corrected thanks to this useful tool.

</details>

### CSS3

Css passed official [W3C Validator testing](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea).
I ran a direct input check on my CSS file and found no errors. There were no warnings or mistakes in my CSS code that I needed to fix. I was able to get everything fully correct.

### Lighthouse

All the pages were tested with [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) using the [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) resource.

- Performance:

    - To improve performance I limited the number of images on all pages.

    - Most images were resized and reformated to reduce data consumption.

    - Went as feasibly low in quality for the images without damaging the cosmetic appeal of the website.

    - High scores throughout the website.

- Accessibility: 

    - Colors were changed in the footer and background for all pages for better contrast.

    - Font sizes were adjusted.

    - Placement of headings adjusted where possible.

    - Missing alt/aria labels added to forms and images.

- Best Practices:

    - Displayed images either are or are near the correct aspect ratio.

    - HTMl doc type included in the html for all pages.

    - All links to external websites have the attribute 'noopener' allowing safe browsing.

- Search Engine Optimization:

    - Semantic HTML included in all internal pages created.

    - IDs added to sections.

    - All links have descriptive text added.

    - Alt attributes added to their respecitve images.

    - Meta data descriptions added to each internal page created.

    - All font sizes are 100% legible text.

# Bugs

## Fixed Bugs

The only major issue encountered was making the site responsive. I did not fully understand viewport height as a unit of measurment when I began building the project and it led to time being taking up to fix my mistake. I had to go back and change a lot of css code to use percentages and pixels as units of measurements. I mananged to fix it by tracking all my measurements correctly.

## Unfixed bugs

On small displays, the fixed background inside the food menu will not function. I looked on StackOverflow and everywhere else for help with this problem. I figured out it had a lot to do with my elements' parent-child relationship being set to 'absolute,' but I ran out of time to figure it out, so I simply put in a quick workaround that seemed to work. At lower screens, I changed the background attachment's value, and while it's not as fixed as it is on larger screens, it's at least operating as I intended.

# Deployment

## Version Control

I used [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) as a local repository and IDE & [GitHub](https://github.com) as a remote repository.

1. To begin with, I needed to create a new repository on GitHub [raza-noodles](https://github.com/KristianColville1/raza-noodles).
2. Then I opened that repository on GitPod by prefixing 'gitpod.io/' at the start of the URL in Github when I was in the repository.
3. GitPod opened a new workspace for me.
4. I created some files and folders.
5. To push my newly created files to GitHub I used a Bash terminal:

    *   **git add (name of file)** *This selects the file for the commit*
    *   **git commit -m "Commit message: (i.e. Initial commit)"** *Allows the developer to assign a specific concise statement to the commit*
    *   **git push** *The final command sends the code to GitHub*

## GitHub Pages

When I finished the homepage for Raza Noodles, I looked for a way to deploy the website. As a deployment solution, I chose the version control system [GitHub](https://github.com). They have an excellent resource called [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) that allows developers to visually inspect how their website would look on a cloud platform.

1. To begin, I went to the repository and selected 'settings.'
2. I went to the 'pages' section.
3. I chose the master branch as the 'main' branch under 'source.'
4. I ensured that it was deployed from the 'root' directory.
5. Once completed, I got the website's URL.

## How to clone this Repository

Heres six steps to clone the repository: 

1. Log into your [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
2. Create a new repository and give it a name.
3. At the top of this repository click the green button labelled code.
4. Click on HTTPS option and copy the URL link to your clipboard.
5. Open your chosen [IDE](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-an-ide), please note [git](https://git-scm.com/) must be installed.
6. Open your terminal in the IDE and type: git clone the-URL-from-here.

Congradulations you now have a clone of this repository on your local machine.
