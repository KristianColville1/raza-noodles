<summary>Strategy</summary>
<br>

### Strategy
It is not possible to compete for business solely on a local level. Companies have a plethora of resources at their disposal in this day and age. One of them is to compete online by having a website that can help a business stand out in the overcrowded world of fine dining.

- Build Raza Noodles a website to connect them with customers so they can experience their Asian cuisine.
- We can address the needs of users by having a website to browse and having relevant content.

The strategy:

    - Research:
        - Check out the Market.
        - Observe the competition.
        - Find commonalities between the competition.

    - Goals to keep in mind for the website:
        - A high level of design.
        - Contrasting images.
        - Fonts and sizes.
        - The responsivity for devices.

    - Outcomes after research:
        - A food menu is top priority.
        - Gallery page is a must have.
        - Don't distract the customer with the background.
        - Images need to be carefully selected for quality.
        - Address and contact number need to be on the landing page no matter what.

### Scope
It is difficult for a developer to balance reality and content. This table ranks the design of elements 1 through 6 in order of importance. The most important is one, and the least important is six.
My potential design elements are important, but categorizing them is a useful way of completing them for the website's user.

## Colors
<hr>
<details>
<summary>Adobe Color</summary>
<br>

All colors were tested using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer). The contrast checker pointed out my red color as a poor choice for my footer links. I opted for a black contrast instead as it made it visually easier to see when hovered over with a mouse. All colors scored above on all tests with high scores.

<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Black</summary>
<br>

I experimented with several colors for the logo. I studied a lot of information about colors on Google, and I discovered that black is associated with strength, authority, and power.
It also represents prestige, and formality. For Raza Noodles it is perfect.

<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Orange Peel</summary>
<br>

It was difficult to choose an orange color, so I went with a softer, more natural orange called [Orange peel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shades_of_orange#:~:text=Orange%20peel%20is%20the%20color,amber%20on%20the%20color%20wheel.). It is related to joy, pleasure, and warmth. It's also a fairly trendy color, according to [Color Matters](https://www.colormatters.com/color-and-marketing/59-color-symbolism/the-meanings-of-colors).
I experimented with several colors before settling on it as the main contrasting hue on a black background. It's halfway between orange and amber.

<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Outcomes</summary>
<br>

After looking into other websites that offered similar services to Raza Noodles, I found it was a good fit for the concept I was striving to achieve.
It's self evident that the orange peel color has something to do with food. The black fit the role Raza noodles was after, an elegent design.

## Responsive Design 
<hr>

I was able to make the website responsive by primarily using pixels and percentages. The maximum screen sizes, which I implemented, allow the site to adapt to various user screens.
[Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) was the tool I used to make the site responsive.

Many features were not affected until certain widths were reached and those are indicated as n/a.

These adjustments did not apply to the external pages because the policys were created using a generator. External links to other websites were not included in the adjustments because I don't own those websites.

| features / widths | 1920px | 1440px | 1024px | 768px | 425px | 375px | 320px |

I experimented with many approaches for making the site responsive and discovered that using pixels was the most accurate and straightforward method for converting the various items on the pages to a suitable format for each screen size. Because the different portions of this website are all positioned 'absolute,' it made the most sense to use pixels to make it responsive. By doing it this way, I was able to save time. Because of this design, the screen's height is irrelevant.

I tried using viewport height as the unit of measurement for elements on the page, but it had an unacceptably large impact on structural integrity. I can see how these units of measurement could be really useful.
It's just trying to keep the responsive design in mind, which is tricky with viewport height and width. For starters, different gadgets come in a variety of heights and widths. If this design was for a specific device I would find those units of measurement very handy to have.

<hr>

## Validator Testing
<hr>
<details>
<summary>HTML5</summary>
<br>
The HTML passed all official validation from W3C.

I modified items in the landing page section that would have made it impossible for screen readers to grasp the intent behind the divs. The spans displaying these objects now have suitable aria labels. I looked up the proper syntax for this and gave roles to the spans so that they could act as images.
</details>

Css passed official W3C validation.

# Version Control

I used [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) as a local repository and IDE & [GitHub](https://github.com) as a remote repository.

1. To begin with, I needed to create a new repository on GitHub [raza-noodles](https://github.com/KristianColville1/raza-noodles).
2. Then I opened that repository on GitPod by prefixing 'gitpod.io/' at the start of the URL in Github when I was in the repository.
3. GitPod opened a new workspace for me.
4. I created some files and folders.
5. To push my newly created files to GitHub I used a Bash terminal:

    *   **git add (name of file)** *This selects the file for the commit*
    *   **git commit -m "Commit message: (i.e. Initial commit)"** *Allows the developer to assign a specific concise statement to the commit*
    *   **git push** *The final command sends the code to GitHub*

# Deployment

When I finished the homepage for Raza Noodles, I looked for a way to deploy the website. As a deployment solution, I chose the version control system [GitHub](https://github.com). They have an excellent resource called [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) that allows developers to visually inspect how their website would look on a cloud platform.

1. To begin, I went to the repository and selected 'settings.'
2. I went to the 'pages' section.
3. I chose the master branch as the 'main' branch under 'source.'
4. I ensured that it was deployed from the 'root' directory.
5. Once completed, I got the website's URL.

## Content

### The logo
I created the branding logo with help from here [hatchful.shopify.com](https://hatchful.shopify.com/).
I tried to keep in mind that this was an Asian style restaurant and chose the appropriate design for the logo after careful consideration.
The logo features an icon that intuitively shows a bowl of noodles and chopsticks.

### Icons
All of the icons were sourced from [fontawsome](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2&m=free)

### Fonts
Google has a wide varity of free fonts for use. I chose two fonts for my projects from [here](https://fonts.google.com/)

### Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, Cookies Policy
I used a generator to build my policies from [TermsFeed](https://www.termsfeed.com/).
