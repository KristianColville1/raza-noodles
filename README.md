<summary>Strategy</summary>
<br>

## Strategy
It is not possible to compete for business solely on a local level. Companies have a plethora of resources at their disposal in this day and age. One of them is to compete online by having a website that can help a business stand out in the overcrowded world of fine dining.

- Build Raza Noodles a website to connect them with customers so they can experience their Asian cuisine.
- We can address the needs of users by having a website to browse and having relevant content.

The strategy:

    - Research:
        - Check out the Market.
        - Observe the competition.
        - Find commonalities between the competition.

    - Goals to keep in mind for the website:
        - A high level of design.
        - Contrasting images.
        - Fonts and sizes.
        - The responsivity for devices.

    - Outcomes after research:
        - A food menu is top priority.
        - Gallery page is a must have.
        - Don't distract the customer with the background.
        - Images need to be carefully selected for quality.
        - Address and contact number need to be on the landing page no matter what.

## Scope
It is difficult for a developer to balance reality and content. This table ranks the design of elements 1 through 6 in order of importance. The most important is one, and the least important is six.
My potential design elements are important, but categorizing them is a useful way of completing them for the website's user.

On the menu page we also have the actual food menu. This allows the user to see what options are available to them and fufills design requirements by Raza Noodles for a competitive design.
The food menu has multiple images, relevant content.

At the beginning of the food menu theres a second option for downloading the food menu.

The menu presents the illusion that it is a three-piece fold out menu on larger screens. 

![Food-menu](/assets/images/features/three-piece-menu.png)

On medium screens its a two-piece fold out menu and having the inset border in between each section creates these classic menu looks whilst adding abit of creativity.

For small screens the menu becomes a single column and shows how adaptible this food menu is. The food menu section has 3 major shift changes overall.

Users can log in or create an account on the website. The user must fill up their information, and the page instructs them on how to do so. There are two forms for the various sign-in options. The user is directed to our 404 error page after completing the form. Raza Noodles currently does not have any servers available to handle user data. More information about this may be found in the website's aspirations and features that still need to be implemented. [Features left to implement](#features-left-to-implement).

<details>
<summary>404 error page</summary>
<br>

As mentioned previously for the sign in page the 404 error page is displayed when the user completes a sign in option. Its mostly decorative with the intent of being a message Raza Noodle can choose to display. I chose to alert the user that currently the server is down and to check back again later. It also provides the user with away back to the home page after an error occurs.

![404 error page](/assets/images/features/error-page.png)

<br>

<details>
<summary>Downloadable content, Address and phone number</summary>

The website features 3 ways the user can view the menu; The drop down menu option for download, the food menu page, & the option for download in the food menu. All providing the user a content rich menu to explore.

![Download option](/assets/images/features/download-option-one.png)
![Download option](/assets/images/features/download-option-two.png)

Raza Noodles' address and phone number can be found on the landing page and menu page. I've included a function that allows the user to dial the phone number just by pressing it. Raza Noodles needs the ability for users to call them when they visit the website. The user will be asked if they wish to call the number by just tapping the number. I've indicated this by placing a calling icon next to the phone number. To help the user understand that this is a calling feature, it is the same color as the menu options.

## Colors
<hr>
<details>
<summary>Adobe Color</summary>
<br>

All colors were tested using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer). The contrast checker pointed out my red color as a poor choice for my footer links. I opted for a black contrast instead as it made it visually easier to see when hovered over with a mouse. All colors scored above on all tests with high scores.

<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Black</summary>
<br>

I experimented with several colors for the logo. I studied a lot of information about colors on Google, and I discovered that black is associated with strength, authority, and power.
It also represents prestige, and formality. For Raza Noodles it is perfect.

<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Orange Peel</summary>
<br>

It was difficult to choose an orange color, so I went with a softer, more natural orange called [Orange peel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shades_of_orange#:~:text=Orange%20peel%20is%20the%20color,amber%20on%20the%20color%20wheel.). It is related to joy, pleasure, and warmth. It's also a fairly trendy color, according to [Color Matters](https://www.colormatters.com/color-and-marketing/59-color-symbolism/the-meanings-of-colors).
I experimented with several colors before settling on it as the main contrasting hue on a black background. It's halfway between orange and amber.

<br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Outcomes</summary>
<br>

After looking into other websites that offered similar services to Raza Noodles, I found these colors as a good fit for the concept I was striving to achieve.
It's self evident that the orange peel color has something to do with food. The black fit the role Raza noodles was after, an elegent design.

Raza Noodles is an Asian style resturant. However, I felt after research during the strategy section that the less gimmicky it looked the better. This resturant is not a common fast-food enterprise so it needed to be presented as syphosticated and in its own way it reached those goals.

The images selected are beautiful, anyone interested in noodles that was hungry would find those images delectable. The black background sucks the viewers eyes into the page creating a focus that does not strain the eyes but lifts the viewers attention to the capabilities of this resturant. The colors in the images go with eachother and add great contrast.

There's abit of extra color brought in with these images. I spent along time trying to make this website as cohesive as possible and I am satisfied with my images.

All text on the homepage was wrote by myself.

The menu page food item text was sourced from online. (finish this)

## Responsive Design

I was able to make the website responsive by primarily using pixels and percentages. The maximum screen sizes, which I implemented, allow the site to adapt to various user screens.
[Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) was the tool I used to make the site responsive.

Many features were not affected until certain widths were reached and those are indicated as n/a.

These adjustments did not apply to the external pages because the policys were created using a generator. External links to other websites were not included in the adjustments because I don't own those websites.

Personal breakpoints for the website are also denoted with 'pbp'. The most work needs to be done on the Menu page, which was done on purpose because it is a key feature of the Raza Noodles website. The Menu page layout changes dramatically for different screen sizes. It was the most challenging to make responsive, but personal breakpoints made it incredibly adaptable.

| features / widths | 1920px | 1440px | 1024px | 768px | 425px | 375px | 320px |
| -------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Menu                 | Shown | Shown | Shown | Hidden | Hidden | Hidden | Hidden |
| Hamburger menu        | Hidden | Hidden | Hidden | Shown | Shown | Shown | Shown |
| logos                | n/a | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | Adjusted | n/a | n/a |
| Landing page         | n/a | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | Adjusted | Adjusted | n/a |
| Dropdown menu        | n/a | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | Adjusted | n/a | n/a |
| Logo fade            | n/a | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | Adjusted | Adjusted | n/a |
| Scroll icons         | n/a | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | Adjusted | Adjusted | n/a |
| About section        | n/a | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | Adjusted | Adjusted | n/a |
| Opening hours section | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | Adjusted | Adjusted | n/a | Adjusted |
| Footer               | n/a | n/a | n/a | Adjusted | Adjusted | Adjusted | n/a |
| External Links       | x | x | x | x | x | x | x |
| Menu page            | pbp | pbp | pbp | pbp | pbp | pbp | pbp |
| Gallery page         | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| Contact page         | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |

I experimented with many approaches for making the site responsive and discovered that using pixels was the most accurate and straightforward method for converting the various items on the pages to a suitable format for each screen size. Because the different portions of this website are all positioned 'absolute,' it made the most sense to use pixels to make it responsive. By doing it this way, I was able to save time. Because of this design, the screen's height is irrelevant.

I tried using viewport height as the unit of measurement for elements on the page, but it had an unacceptably large impact on structural integrity. I can see how these units of measurement could be really useful.
It's just trying to keep the responsive design in mind, which is tricky with viewport height and width. For starters, different gadgets come in a variety of heights and widths. If this design was for a specific device I would find those units of measurement very handy to have.

## Validator Testing

<hr>

### HTML5

All internal pages passed official [W3C Validator testing](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea). The policy pages are excluded as they are were generated. I tested my pages by putting the URL of each page into their HTML checker.

I corrected all problems the html checker indicated. The html checker pointed out missing aria labels, incorrect id's classes and semantic issues. All were corrected thanks to this useful tool.

### CSS3

Css passed official [W3C Validator testing](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea).
I ran a direct input check on my CSS file and found no errors. There were no warnings or mistakes in my CSS code that I needed to fix. I was able to get everything fully correct.

### Lighthouse

To improve these scores, I downsized graphics and changed the color of the footer. For most of the web pages, especially the menu page, the performance score was originally lower than I expected. As much as feasible, images were resized. I purposefully allowed wiggle area for the menu page because it has a lot more going on, and I'm happy with the results of all the pages after using [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) to configure them with [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse).

The accessibility score is only let down by the way I have implemented a hamburger menu. I have provided an 'aria-roledescription' to hopefully counter act this features let down. It provides the screen reader with an opportunity to understand the role of the hamburger menu. 

Although I can heavily rely on common sense for the hamburger menu's purpose, going forward that feature will be implemented very differently. This project is pure HTML5 and CSS3. I'm incredibly delighted with the results overall and what I achieved with those languages.

# Version Control

I used [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) as a local repository and IDE & [GitHub](https://github.com) as a remote repository.

1. To begin with, I needed to create a new repository on GitHub [raza-noodles](https://github.com/KristianColville1/raza-noodles).
2. Then I opened that repository on GitPod by prefixing 'gitpod.io/' at the start of the URL in Github when I was in the repository.
3. GitPod opened a new workspace for me.
4. I created some files and folders.
5. To push my newly created files to GitHub I used a Bash terminal:

    *   **git add (name of file)** *This selects the file for the commit*
    *   **git commit -m "Commit message: (i.e. Initial commit)"** *Allows the developer to assign a specific concise statement to the commit*
    *   **git push** *The final command sends the code to GitHub*

# Deployment

When I finished the homepage for Raza Noodles, I looked for a way to deploy the website. As a deployment solution, I chose the version control system [GitHub](https://github.com). They have an excellent resource called [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) that allows developers to visually inspect how their website would look on a cloud platform.

1. To begin, I went to the repository and selected 'settings.'
2. I went to the 'pages' section.
3. I chose the master branch as the 'main' branch under 'source.'
4. I ensured that it was deployed from the 'root' directory.
5. Once completed, I got the website's URL.
