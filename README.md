# Deployment
When I finished the homepage for Raza Noodles, I looked for a way to deploy the website. As a deployment solution, I chose the version control system GitHub. They have an excellent resource called GitHub pages that allows developers to visually inspect how their website would look on a cloud platform.

    1. Firstly, I went to the repository and clicked on settings.
    2. Navigated to the pages section.
    3. Under source I selected the master branch as main.
    4. Made sure it was deployed using the root directory.
    5. Once completed I was then given the url for the website.
